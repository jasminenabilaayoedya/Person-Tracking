A city requires an intelligent system to automatically detect and track human movement to enhance public safety. This project implements the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm using the COCO-2017 dataset to identify and track people in real time. The model’s performance and characteristics are analyzed to determine its effectiveness and suitability for smart city surveillance applications.
